This file contains an overview of the major enhancement, bug fixes, or
other things for each version of ginnungagap since version 0.5.0.  If
relevant, the entries contain the short hash of the according commits to
the repository, smaller changes will not be listed individually but
paraphrased.


Version 0.5.2-alpha
-------------------

This is the alpha release of ginnungagap-0.5.2.  This brings writing
support for HDF5 and improves the build system.  The biggest chance is
the way how MPI is handled in the build system.
Changes from 0.5.1-alpha:
 46 files changed, 2039 insertions(+), 406 deletions(-)

* (4d4de93) Adds curie to the systems.

* (17d9d4e) Adds erebos to the known systems.
    This sets the SPRNG and FFT details for erebos to use the libraries 
    installed in /z/knolli/opt/.  Setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is still the 
    responsibility of the user.  The system settings differ depending on
    the choice of --toolchain (intel and gcc are dealt with).

* (15c25b5) Fixes segfault related to histograms.
    When the calculation of histograms is switched off in the ini file (or 
    rather not switched on), then they really shouldn't be done.

* (40af9c2) Fixes filtering/chunking for the HDF5 writer.
    This now allows the writer to write to chunked data sets and apply 
    various filters to the data set.  Filters are, however, only available 
    in the serial version of the library, hence all filters are switched
    off the hard way, when the code is compiled with MPI.

* (a6261ee) HDF5 writer can now write grids.
    This implements the writing of grids (and, untested, patches). 
    Theoretically, it also supports compression and checksumming, albeit 
    untested.

* (1a84d88) Allows distributed grids to always get the rank.
    Retrieving the local rank of the calling process within the grid 
    distribution was a feature of the MPI-version of the distribution 
    module.  This is now always available and will return the rank 0 if the 
    distribution is not in MPI mode.  Test functions have been adjusted 
    accordingly.

* (94d6069) Fixes issue with MPI tests and adds OpenMP to MPI.
    Will set a Makefile variable for mpiexec which will include the path as 
    given by WITH_MPI_BIN_DIR.  Note that this directory must be either 
    given by the user, or it will be constructed by 'dirname' from
    'which mpicc'.

    Also, the build system now re-enables MPI+OpenMP by adding the required 
    OpenMP flags not only to CC but also to MPICC.

* (d951872) Fixes issues with the pdf documentation.
    When generating the latex documentation it seems that doxygen produces 
    broken TeX code if name-block contain any text.  This is circumvented 
    now by either moving the extra text to the file description, or
    deleting it.

* (ef7524c) Changes how MPI is handled in the build system.
    This will now explicitly set and use MPICC.  Makefiles that deal with 
    code that has to be compiled with MPI now will set CC to MPICC.  That 
    allows to compile code that has no dependency on MPI without any 
    reference to MPI.  Implementation of this change required adjusting
    most of the Makefiles and additionally a few irrelevant MPI
    dependencies have been removed from a few test functions.

    The way MPI is handled in by the configure is now:  --with-mpi will
    take an argument that is either no to not use MPI at all, or yes, which
    will use MPI and assume the MPI compiler to be 'mpicc', or any other
    word that will then be taken as the value for MPICC.  This should now
    be the executable without any path.  If the MPICC is in a non-standard 
    directory, then --with-mpi-bin-dir can be used to point to the proper 
    directory in which MPICC can be found.

    The configure script will now report which MPICC is being used and 
    include the full path in the output.  The path is either taken from the 
    user via --with-mpi-bin-dir or deduced via 'which MPICC' (that requires 
    MPICC to be in the PATH).

    All these changes are now used in the example configure.systems.own (in 
    doc/devel/) to allow for a compilation without sourcing any module. 
    Note that the build system does not try to resolve runtime dependency, 
    i.e. to run the code the user needs to ensure that all shared libraries 
    are actually found by the linker.

* (2bfbe5d) Adds a configure.systems.own for development.
    This is only for internal use, though users might find it helpful to 
    have a look at the file.

* (d1ebdd0) Documentation update for gridPatch.
    This will now completely document the gridPatch module.  Additionally,
    a few missing const qualifiers have been added to some functions.

* (d66541c) Adds a gridPatch function to retrieve data by var.
    This now allows to retrieve the data handle of a variable attached to a 
    patch by searching for the variable itself.  Previously, the only way
    to get the data handle was by passing the index of the data.

* (9823274) Fixes problems with HDF5 libs.
    The HDF5 libraries where not properly propagated through the build 
    chain.

* (cd2d61e) Changes the way configure deals with HDF5.
    Now that HDF5 is itself a supported output format of ginnungagap, the 
    configure script has been adapted so that the HDF5 backend of Silo is 
    not chosen automatically when --with-hdf5 is specified.  To use the
    HDF5 backend, --with-silo=hdf5 must be used now.


Version 0.5.1-alpha
-------------------

This is the alpha release of ginnungagap-0.5.1.  The release focuses
mainly on the build system and documentation updates.  The main addition
to the code base is the framework for the HDF5 reader/writer for the
grid library.
Changes from 0.5.0-alpha:
 58 files changed, 1932 insertions(+), 404 deletions(-)

* (2624744) Adds option for predefined systems to configure.
    This now allows to use --system=SYSTEM with the configure script to 
    configure the code according to a predefined set for a given machine. 
    No actual predefined system is included yet, only the system 'full' is 
    available, which will switch on all features the code has.

    The users may define their own systems by means of writing their own 
    definition in an extra file (configure.systems.own) that will be 
    evaluated if it exists.  An example of this file is included in 
    doc/examples/.

* (b4192e4) Adds a file to collect useful git commands.
    This is mainly meant to have a set of git commands related to querying
    the history of the repository for writing change logs.  Before they are
    forgotten yet again, it seems better to have a cheat sheet.

* (fbfbeaa) Adds an install target to the Makefile.
    This now allows to 'install' all generated binaries into a (possibly 
    user-defined) directory.  The default is to move the binaries from
    their respective source directory into bin/ in the top directory.

* (816658f) Updates doxygen configuration.
    Now also extracting static members (so that the call graph images work 
    smoothly) and adding a tag line to the project documentation.

* (b8fad9d) Adds stubs for the HDF5 libgrid-IO.
    This only provides a compilable set of files which at the moment do not 
    actually do anything.  They cause a bunch of compiler warnings about 
    unused variables.

* Numerous updates to the code documentation.


Version 0.5.0-alpha
-------------------

This is the alpha release of ginnungagap-0.5.0.  This is essentially
the version that was presented at the ginnungagap workshop in Madrid
on the 21th of September 2011.  This version includes two small fixes
to the realSpaceConstraints program that fix is to also work when
compiled with MPI.
