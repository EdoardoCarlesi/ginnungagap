This file contains an overview of the major enhancement, bug fixes, or
other things for each version of ginnungagap since version 0.5.0.  If
relevant, the entries contain the short hash of the according commits to
the repository, smaller changes will not be listed individually but
paraphrased.


Version 0.5.1-alpha
-------------------

This is the alpha release of ginnungagap-0.5.1.  The release focuses
mainly on the build system and documentation updates.  The main addition
to the code base is the framework for the HDF5 reader/writer for the
grid library.
Changes from 0.5.0-alpha:
55 files changed, 1867 insertions(+), 402 deletions(-)

* (2624744) Adds option for predefined systems to configure.
    This now allows to use --system=SYSTEM with the configure script to 
    configure the code according to a predefined set for a given machine. 
    No actual predefined system is included yet, only the system 'full' is 
    available, which will switch on all features the code has.

    The users may define their own systems by means of writing their own 
    definition in an extra file (configure.systems.own) that will be 
    evaluated if it exists.  An example of this file is included in 
    doc/examples/.

* (b4192e4) Adds a file to collect useful git commands.
    This is mainly meant to have a set of git commands related to querying
    the history of the repository for writing change logs.  Before they are
    forgotten yet again, it seems better to have a cheat sheet.

* (fbfbeaa) Adds an install target to the Makefile.
    This now allows to 'install' all generated binaries into a (possibly 
    user-defined) directory.  The default is to move the binaries from
    their respective source directory into bin/ in the top directory.

* (816658f) Updates doxygen configuration.
    Now also extracting static members (so that the call graph images work 
    smoothly) and adding a tag line to the project documentation.

* (b8fad9d) Adds stubs for the HDF5 libgrid-IO.
    This only provides a compilable set of files which at the moment do not 
    actually do anything.  They cause a bunch of compiler warnings about 
    unused variables.

* Numerous updates to the code documentation.


Version 0.5.0-alpha
-------------------

This is the alpha release of ginnungagap-0.5.0.  This is essentially
the version that was presented at the ginnungagap workshop in Madrid
on the 21th of September 2011.  This version includes two small fixes
to the realSpaceConstraints program that fix is to also work when
compiled with MPI.
