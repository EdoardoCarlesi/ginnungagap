These are the build instruction for `ginnungagap'.


Basic build
===========

To build the code, two files need to be generated: config.h and
Makefile.config.  The former encodes compile-time parameters and the
latter sets the build system/compiler/etc.  A configure script is
included in this distribution, that can be used to generate these two
files, run `./configure --help' to get an overview over the available
options.

  Once these two files are generated, `make' will build the program and
leave you with the executable in src/.  Of course you can also generate
the two files yourself, have a look at `config.h.in' and
`Makefile.config.in' for the structure.
