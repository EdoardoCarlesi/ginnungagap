{"name":"Ginnungagap","tagline":"Inital conditions generator for cosmological simulations","body":"Ginnungagap is a code for generating cosmological initial conditions. It is aimed at high scalability and ease of use. The main code will generate the velocity field at the requested starting redshift, which is then used by extra tools to generated a particle representation. Furthermore, tools are provided to generate realisations at different resolution levels while keeping the large scale structure fixed (by means of refining the underlying white noise field).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
