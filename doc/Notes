External Dependencies:

SPRNG:  - sprng-2.0b
        - Built serial version, ginnungagap uses an explicit method of
          setting the streams and the seeds, no MPI collective calls are
          needed from sprng itself

fftw2:  - fftw2-2.1.5
        - Built with type prefix switched on (--enable-type-prefix)
        - Built double and float interface, if you want to be able to
          choose between double and float precision, otherwise only
          build the one you need.

mpi:    - openmpi-1.2(?)
        - nothing special
