External Dependencies:

SPRNG:  - sprng-2.0b
        - Built serial version, ginnungagap uses an explicit method of
          setting the streams and the seeds, no MPI collective calls are
          needed from sprng itself

fftw:   - fftw3-3.2.2
        - No need for the parallel version, ginnungagap does *A LOT* of
          1D transforms and explicitly parallelizes over those.

mpi:    - openmpi-1.2(?)
        - nothing special

gsl:    - nothing special here, GSL is needed for integration routines
          and spline fitting

The following two libraries are required for IO:

HDF5:   - hdf5-1.8.4p1
        - It is possible to use the PDB backend of silo, however, HDF5
          is strongly recommended.

SILO:   - silo-4.7.2
        - Make sure that silo uses HDF5
