This file lists the external dependencies that ginnungagap uses and
provides some information about them (like: why? which version?).



External Dependencies:


Required:

FFTW:   - fftw3-3.2.2 (or any other FFTW3 version, FFTW2 is not yet
          supported)
        - No need for the MPI parallel version, however, OpenMP or
          threaded version is advised.  Ginnungagap does nothing to
          parallelize local transforms --- only global transforms are
          MPI parallel --- and hence relies on FFTW to do what it deems
          suitable.

GSL:    - nothing special here, GSL is needed for integration routines
          and spline fitting


Optional:

SPRNG:  - sprng-2.0b
        - Built serial version, ginnungagap uses an explicit method of
          setting the streams and the seeds, no MPI collective calls are
          needed from sprng itself
        - SPRNG is optional, iff the white noise field is read from a
          file instead of being generated on the fly.

MPI:    - openmpi-1.2
        - nothing special
        - any MPI-2 library will do, actually, testing is done with
          OpenMPI though

SILO:   - silo-4.7.2 (this is the version testing is done with, older
          and newer ones might work as well)
        - Make sure that silo uses HDF5

HDF5:   - hdf5-1.8.4p1 (or any version that Silo supports)
        - It is possible to use the PDB backend of silo, however, HDF5
          is strongly recommended.
