External Dependencies:

SPRNG:  - sprng-2.0b
        - Built serial version, ginnungagap uses an explicit method of
          setting the streams and the seeds, no MPI collective calls are
          needed from sprng itself

FFTW:   - fftw3-3.2.2
        - No need for the MPI parallel version, however, OpenMP or
          threaded version is advised.  Ginnungagap does nothing to
          parallelize local transforms --- only global transforms are
          MPI parallel --- and hence relies and FFTW to do what it deems
          suitable.

MPI:    - openmpi-1.2(?)
        - nothing special

GSL:    - nothing special here, GSL is needed for integration routines
          and spline fitting

The following two libraries are required for IO:

HDF5:   - hdf5-1.8.4p1
        - It is possible to use the PDB backend of silo, however, HDF5
          is strongly recommended.

SILO:   - silo-4.7.2
        - Make sure that silo uses HDF5
