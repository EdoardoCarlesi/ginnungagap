 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * Ginnungagap is a code for generating cosmological initial conditions.
 * It is aimed at high scalability and ease of use.
 *
 * \section requirements  Requirements
 *
 * To successfully compile ginnungagap, the following prerequisites must
 * be met:
 *
 * - <b>C compiler</b> - Since ginnungagap uses features specific to
 *   C99, a compiler supporting this standard is required.
 * - <b>Build tools</b> - A make command should be available.
 *   Ginnugagap has been tested with GNU make and other makes might not
 *   support all features used in the Makefiles.  In case make is not
 *   GNU make, your system has most likely gmake available.
 * - <b>Shell</b> - A couple of Shell scripts need to be executed during
 *   the build process, most prominently the configure script.  They are
 *   supposed to work on POSIX shells and are tested on bash and dash.
 *
 * Additionally, the following libraries should be available to make
 * full use of ginnungagap:
 *
 * - <b>SPRNG</b> -
 * - <b>MPI</b> - 
 * - <b>Silo</b> -
 * - <b>HDF5</b> -
