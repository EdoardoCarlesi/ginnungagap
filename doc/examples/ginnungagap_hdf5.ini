# This is an example ini file for ginnungagap.
# The code will set up initial conditions on a 200^3 grid in a 99 Mpc/h
# box at redshift 90.  The resulting fields will be written in HDF5
# format to the files ic_delta.h5, ic_velx.h5, ic_vely.h5, and
# ic_velz.h5; any previously existing file with any of that names will
# be overwritten, mercilessly.  The initial white noise field is read
# from the file wn.hdf5.  The initial power spectrum is generated from
# the cosmological parameters using the Eisenstein & Hu 1998
# approximation for the transfer function.
#
# Note that the [rng] section is intentionally missing, as the white
# noise data is read from a file instead.
