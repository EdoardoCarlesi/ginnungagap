# Select the used toolchain to generate the objects, executables, etc.
# You can select a variety of predefined toolchains (see the end of the
# comment for a list), but you can also define your own name, provided
# that you implement it accordingly at the end of this file.  The
# toolchain will set the following variables:
#   CC    :  This is the C compiler to use.
#   CFLAGS:  Special flags for the C compiler can be set here.
#   DEPCC:   This is a C Preprocessor that will be used to
#            auto-generate dependencies, it is a safe bet to use gcc
#            for that.  No code will be generated with that compiler!
#   LD   :   The linker.
#   AR   :   The archiver.
#   MAKE :   The make command that will be used.
# Note that by defining any of those variables during the run of the
# configure script, the toolchain variables will be overwritten with the
# command line variables.  The exception to this is CFLAGS: the user
# can specify specific flags and the ones required by the toolchain will
# be appended to those at the end.
